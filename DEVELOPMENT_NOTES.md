# NOTES


### Things to document about NHLL


## Preprocessor

What commands go where, what do they do, and what needs to be done

## Global Variables

They are pre-computed at compile-time. Expressions can have all operators found in the postfix class, 
and the rules for when things get up/down converted to/from double/int64 need to be laid out in the NHLL documentation
