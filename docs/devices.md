# Nabla Devices

## Register Key

Devices that are used by the Nabla VM will key off of register 10. At the end of an instruction cycle, if a device sees information regarding its operation in r10 it will act accordingly. 

### What does this mean ? 

Don't use registers 10 - 15 without a clear goal. They are reserved for device operations
