## Primitives

I would like to expand this, but for now the following will be the primitives

str  - A string, or a char. Some manner of text

int  - Integer

real - A 'real' number "double"

nil  - Not anything. Void, etc


# Future additions
vec<type>   - 1d Vector

mat<type, x(int), y(int)>   - Matrix

stream<type, dir(in, out)> - A channel-like structure
