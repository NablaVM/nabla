## Development Updates: 

***30/ May/ 2020***

:sparkles: The first iteration of the Grammar has been written! Right now Nabla HLL gets piped to a code generator, but that generator isn't doing much except dumping some text of things that is has in-hand. I decided to do the merge to master to logically differenciate the grammar setup from the codegen. The next step will be to implement basic code generation so I can start writing the primitive memory managment stuff. Once the memory management code is in place the grammar will be extended to to support arrays, sets, and matrices. 

:hammer: Hopefully the above won't take too long, but it might. After the basic types have been implemented, then I will figure out if I want to actually support user-defined objects. I probrably will. I like objects. Check the project board to see the state of development, as this README might not be updated until the first iteration of the HLL is implemented. 

***15/ May/ 2020***

:rocket: Assembly and byte code have been fully fleshed out. 

:boom: There now exists an ASM syntax highlighting extension for VSCode (see below).

:space_invader: The Nabla HLL will now begin to be developed. 

### About 

The goal of Nabla is to establish a high level programming language on top of a register based virtual machine. The purpose is to explore the different aspects of language and virtual machine creation. 

### Language and Instruction set

As of now the high level language for Nabla has not yet been established. Work is still being done on the virtual machine. Once the project gets to a point that it can support all required aspects of computation, the high level language will begin to be developed. 
For now, Nabla is usable with the Nabla ASM code [described here](https://github.com/NablaVM/nabla/wiki/Nabla-ASM). Writing assembly isn't everyone's cup of tea, but Nabla ASM isn't all that bad. Just write the code, and feed it into the [Solace](https://github.com/NablaVM/solace) application to have a binary assembled that can be executed by Nabla.

### Byte Code

Nabla ASM represents 64-bit fixed-width machine instructions (byte code ...or.. 8-byte code?). 64-bit seems a bit heavy for a virtual machine that just runs a language, but since Nabla is a register-based virtual machine and not a stack-based faker it needed some detailed instructions. These detailed instructions allow us to express lots of information so we can do lots with each instruction.
