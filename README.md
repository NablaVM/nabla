### About 

The goal of Nabla is to establish a high level programming language on top of a register based stack machine. The purpose is to explore the different aspects of language and virtual machine creation. 

### Language and Instruction set

As of now the high level language for Nabla has not yet been established. Work is still being done on the virtual machine. Once the project gets to a point that it can support all required aspects of computation, the high level language will begin to be developed. 
For now, Nabla is usable with the Nabla ASM code [describe here](https://github.com/bosley/nabla/wiki/Nabla-ASM). Writing assembly isn't everyone's cup of tea, but Nabla ASM isn't all that bad. Just write the code, and feed it into the [Solace](https://github.com/bosley/nabla/tree/master/src/apps/solace) application to have a binary assembled that can be executed by Nabla.

### Byte Code

Nabla ASM represents 64-bit fixed-width machine instructions (byte code ...or.. 8-byte code?). 64-bit seems a bit heavy for a virtual machine that just runs a language, but since Nabla is a register-based virtual machine and not a stack-based faker it needed some detailed instructions. These detailed instructions allow us to express lots of information so we can do lots with each instruction.
To find out more about the Nabla byte code, check out the documentation [here](https://github.com/bosley/nabla/wiki/Nabla-Byte-Code). 

### Applications

Inside the src of this repo there exists an 'apps' directory. In this directory 3 apps can be found. Solace, Harp, and Nabla. 

**Solace** : This is the assembler. It takes hand-crafted assembly instructions and generates a binary file that can be executed by nabla.

**Harp** : Harp is an analyzer that can read in a compiled binary and help debug problems with code. As of the writing of this readme, you can manually step the VM 1 instruction at a time, check out all of the memory and register values, and even dump all instructions that are loaded into any given function. Its really neat, and had been a huge help in developing Nabla. 

**Nabla** : Obviously this is where the cake is. Nabla is the application that takes in and executes byte code. It currently works only with compiled binary files produced by Solace, but as the high level language is developed, it will also be responsible for dropping a user into an interpreter. _wow!_ This means that code will be able to be compiled to byte code AND interpreted! Wild. The particulars of how the interpreter will work, and what the syntax for the high level language hasn't been thought out yet. Once they start to get created documents in the Nabla wiki will be made available.
